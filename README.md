# LeLGur
A small image sharing site

This application is built using:

Backend: Java with Spring framework, Maven, HSQLDB.
         Backend is a REST API.

Frontend: AngularJS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Bower
          Angular controllers/services communicate with the backend REST API.
          
Both ends are hosted on Heroku, and might be a sleep at the moment. Starting them will take some time,
so don't wonder if loading or uploading pictures takes a while.
There might be no pictures in the database when you open the application, this is because the application
might been a sleep before you used it (this emtpies the DB).

Features:
 - uploading a picture
 - pictures having own pages
 - commenting on pictures
 - works now better on mobile
